This laboratory focuses on system biology approaches to connect sequence to mechanism and structure, bridging clinical and basic research.Â Mehdi Bouhaddou, a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco, who is now a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised me in the internship from January 2022 to October 2022.

# Purpose
1. Performed statistical analysis and modeling on biological information from unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomics information
2. Computationally created a genome annotated map depicting nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations for each SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern
3. Performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA software) based on canonical pathways, corum, and gene ontology to analyze differential gene expression in knockout and wild-type human cells with a disrupted Sacsin gene protein network
